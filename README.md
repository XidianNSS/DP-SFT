The DP-SFT folder contains our methods.
The Subspace-tuning folder contains subspace fine-tuning experiments in a non-private environment.
The Adapter-DP, LoRa-DP, and Full-DP folders all contain corresponding baseline experiments.
In the Subspace-tuning project, parameter snapshots will be saved to the disk, which can be used for subsequent subspace transferability experiments.
In the DP-SFT project, you can comment out the first-stage operations in the main file and specify the parameter snapshot path to conduct transferability experiments.
